What is this?
=============

A prototype module loader for Microsoft's on{X} Android app.

But why?
--------

Because I wanted to share common functions and stuff between rules. And because I had an idea and had to see if it was a good one.

Usage
-----

Put the contents of ModuleLoader.js in a rule. See TestRule.js and ExampleModule.js for how to use it.

Roadmap
-------

* Build real rules using the loader and see if it actually works.
* Clean up the code.
* Figure out how to make console.log work as intended.
* Implement consumer notification when modules are updated.
